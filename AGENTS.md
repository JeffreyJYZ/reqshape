## What this is

`bun`/TypeScript CLI: measures token shape of real opencode traffic, reprices on
any model.

Siblings:

| tool | takes from it |
| --- | --- |
| `mpc` (`~/dev/cmdcode-tools/oc-cmd-compare`) | `mpc --json --shape off` — pricing, allowances, window ratios (`--shape off` mandatory: see Contracts) |
| `cmduse` (Rust CLI) | `cmduse -1 --json` — account request count for the period, context line only |

`MPC_BIN` / `CMDUSE_BIN` point either call at a dev build.

## Layout

```
src/index.ts             entry
src/types.ts             Req (one model call), Ask, Profile, Shape, Stats

## Commands

```sh
bun install
bun test                       # unit tests
bun run typecheck              # tsc --noEmit
bunx biome check --write .     # format + lint (always before commit)
bun run src/index.ts --help
bun link                       # exposes the `reqshape` binary
```

**`bun link` must be re-run after the repo moves, and can be silently pruned.**
Writes `~/.bun/bin/reqshape` → `~/.bun/install/global/node_modules/reqshape/src/index.ts`
(an **absolute** path), so a moved checkout leaves it dangling — and a later
`bun link` in a sibling repo prunes the entry (only `mpc`, which shells it,
notices). Fix: `bun link` here; verify
`test -e ~/.bun/install/global/node_modules/reqshape/src/index.ts` (`ls -l`
proves nothing — the symlink survives dangling).

## The lexicon

- **req** — one model call (`assistant` row); sidebar and billing unit. Agentic
  ask = many reqs.
- **ask** — prompt that opened a run of reqs + those reqs.
- **position** — req's 1-based index in its session; cache read grows along (only
  useful bucket split).
- **per-req vs per-conversation** — two weightings, disagree ~4x.

## Contracts

- `mpc --json`: `plans[<id>].{credits,fiveHour,weekly}` and
  `rows[].{oc,cc}.{pricing{input,output,cacheRead,cacheWrite},allowance,requestsPerMonth,requestsPerFiveHour,requestsPerWeek,free}`.
  Anything else optional. `pricing: null` = *unpriced*, not free; `entriesOf`
  skips it, never prices at zero.
- Window ratios **derived, never restated**: `ratiosOf` prefers plan block
  (`fiveHour / credits`), else row windowed count ÷ monthly count.
- `cmduse -1 --json`: `summary.requests`, `plan`, `periodEnd`. Missing/
  unauthenticated = no account line, never error.
- **`--format json` feeds `mpc`'s `--shape auto`/`--shape measured`**: top-level
  `profile` (same vector as `shape.perReq`) becomes one `Workload`, priced on
  **both** plans. Keep `profile` a bare token vector (mpc rounds means). `auto`
  also reads `shape.reqs`, trusting profile only at mpc's `SHAPE_MIN_REQS` —
  **`shape.reqs` must stay the true kept-req count**, else mpc silently flips
  measured↔fixed. `sides.{oc,cc}` is ours only; mpc ignores it. oc/cc split here
  (`command-code*`/`commandcode` → cc, `opencode*` → oc, else excluded): a new
  CommandCode id goes in `CC_PREFIXES` in `src/constants/providers.ts`.
- **`loadMpc` must call `mpc --json --shape off`**: mpc default `--shape auto`
  shells to `reqshape`, which runs `mpc --json` — recursion (mpc -> reqshape ->
  mpc -> ...). The cycle break, not sugar.
- `sides` additive: old `perReq`/`perSession` consumers unaffected; missing
  `sides` = fallback, not error.

## Rules

- Biome only, tabs width 4, TypeScript, Bun over npm, `cac` only runtime dep.
  Imports: `~/` outside file's own dir, `./` siblings.
- `tsconfig.json` `paths` `~/*`, **no `baseUrl`**. Bun honours it runtime + tests,
  so no build step.
- Tests must not touch network: unit tests build fixtures; live `mpc`/`cmduse` by
  hand, never `bun test`.
- Size limits: ~100 lines/file, hard cap 150; ≤6 entries per dir. Check
  `wc -l $(rg --files -g '*.ts' src test)` + per-dir count. `test/` split
  `cli/`, `measure/`, `market/`, `view/`.
- No re-export-only barrels; import the owning module.

## Traps (each of these was a real bug)

- **cac prints `--help`/`--version` but does not exit** — sets `run = false`, so
  report prints after help. `answeredByCac` sees `help`/`version` in the parsed
  bag; `run()` returns before work. mpc same flaw: match the fix here.
- **`mri` coerces values**: numeric string → number, `""` → `0`, valueless flag
  → `true`. Read all string options via `str()` in `flags.ts`; `number()` refuses
  boolean.
- **cac leaves a digit-dash flag hyphenated**: `--cap-5h` arrives key `"cap-5h"`,
  not `cap5h` — unreadable under camelCase, so it did nothing. Caps
  `--five-hour`/`--weekly`; `test/cli/parse.test.ts` guards this.
- **cac negates a declared flag itself**: declaring `--no-color` *and* reading
  `color === false` let declaration win (`color` default `true`, validation
  failed). Declare `--color` only; `--no-color` arrives `false`.
- **Session metadata lives in two tables**: v2 `session_v2`, legacy `session`
  older. Reading only `session` lost the current session, so `--project`
  matched nothing. Read both, v2 winning.
- **Completed turn carries `cost` and `tokens`; in-flight one does not** — v1 and
  v2 look empty mid-stream. Turns without `tokens` skipped, never zero-token.
- **`cacheRead: null` vs `cacheRead: 0`**: null = no published cache rate (bill
  context at input rates, flag row); zero = cached reads free. Conflating
  fabricates or hides a cost.
- **Reasoning tokens bill as output** on every provider — join the output term in
  `project()`. `tokens.output`/`tokens.reasoning` are *separate* counters, not a
  subset; never fold one into the other, never bill twice. Both add it once:
  `project()` here, mpc's `costPerRequest`.
- **`requestsPerMonth` is `Infinity` for a free model** — serialises to `null`,
  meaning *unbounded*. Keep out of comparisons:
  `sortProjections` compares explicitly because `Infinity - Infinity` is `NaN`.
- **Weighted average is two different numbers here**: do not "fix" per-req mean by
  switching to per-session; both printed, `--weight` picks (they disagree 4x, user
  should see why).

- **Only a `user` row opens an ask; interjections continue it**:
  `synthetic`/`system`/`compaction`/`shell` were boundaries too, so a
  system-reminder between prompt and answer made the answer's reqs a `system` ask,
  which `filterAsks` discarded whole. They now attach to the ask they interrupted.
  `orphan` catches reqs before any user prompt.
- **A legacy store's `providerID` is real**: `readLegacy` hardcoded
  `provider: ""`, so a `message`-only store produced no `sides` and the PER SIDE
  section vanished — `message.data` carries `providerID`.
- **`customOf` watches every custom-model flag**: `--five-hour`/`--weekly`/
  `--label` alone were ignored (`custom: null`, no error) because only rate/budget
  flags set `touched`; a lone one now demands rates + `--budget`.
- **The MODELS line's "…N more" needs the true total**: `modelsOf` caps display
  at 8; `Shape.modelTotal` carries the pre-cap count, so the suffix is not
  `capped - 6`.

## Not in scope

- Registering providers or inventing plans — rates come from `mpc`.
- Caching `mpc --json` — run it when deciding, not continuously.
