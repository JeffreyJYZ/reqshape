# reqshape

Measure the shape of your requests from opencode's own history, then price that
shape against any model — so "how many requests does a $60 allowance actually buy
me?" stops being a guess.

## What it does

A **req** is one model call — the same unit the opencode sidebar counts: a single
`assistant` row in opencode's store. An agentic ask is many reqs, because the
model is called again after every tool result.

`reqshape` reads that history, drops the requests that ask for nothing, averages
the rest, and hands you the answer as a token vector: *one of my requests is
8.2K input, 309 output, 139 reasoning, 248K cache read*. Then it prices that
vector on every model OpenCode Go and CommandCode sell, and divides each plan's
allowance and window caps by the result.

`mpc` answers the same question with a fixed assumption (800 in / 50K cache / 200
out). This answers it with your actual traffic — and usually disagrees, because
context is re-read on every call and yours is deep.

## Why "cache read" is the whole story

Every request re-sends the conversation, and providers bill the re-sent part as
cached tokens. So cache read is not a property of how you prompt; it is a
function of **how far into the conversation you are**:

| position in its session | reqs | cache read / req |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 28 | 579 |
| 2–5 | 107 | 9.9K |
| 6–20 | 356 | 21.5K |
| 21–100 | 1,043 | 62.2K |
| 101+ | 5,737 | 301.5K |

The first request of a conversation is essentially free to re-send; the hundredth
re-sends 300K tokens. On this history **78% of all requests sit at 101+**, which
is why the per-request average (248K) is four times the per-conversation average
(64K) — one enormous session otherwise sets the profile.

`--weight turn` (the default) treats every req as one data point, because that is
the unit you are billed in. `--weight session` gives each conversation one vote
and prices that instead. Both are printed either way, so you can see the gap.

A model with no published cache-read rate is billed for that context at its
**input** rate, and flagged with `*`. This is the single biggest swing in the
table: a model with no caching support is not slightly more expensive for this
traffic, it is unusable.

## Noise filtering

"hi", "thanks", "ok", "continue" are real requests but say nothing about the work
you do. `reqshape` drops an ask — the prompt *and* every req it drove — when:

- its prompt normalises to a keyword (`hi`, `hey there`, `thanks`, `great`,
  `lgtm`, `continue please`, …) — edit the list with `--keywords`
- its prompt is nothing but emoji or punctuation (`--min-chars` adds a length
  floor)
- it produced almost no output (`--min-output N`)

Structural noise is always dropped: auto-generated `synthetic` prompts, the
`compaction` summary turn, `shell` commands, and `system` rows are not requests
you made. `--keep-trivial` turns off the prompt filters and keeps everything else
the same, and `--explain` prints every reason with its count — nothing is
silently discarded.

## Options

| flag | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--weight <mode>` | `turn` | `turn` (every req equal) or `session` (one vote per conversation) |
| `--sessions <mode>` | `all` | `all` includes subagent sessions; `user` drops them |
| `--keywords <list>` | built-in list | comma-separated prompts to treat as noise (replaces the list) |
| `--min-chars <n>` | `0` | also drop prompts shorter than this |
| `--min-output <n>` | `0` | also drop asks that produced fewer output tokens |
| `--keep-trivial` | off | keep every prompt; only structural noise is dropped |
| `--since <date>` | all time | only asks on or after this date |
| `--project <dir>` | all | only sessions whose directory contains this |
| `--model <text>` | all | only model rows whose name contains this |
| `--limit <n>` | all | cap the number of model rows |
| `--sort <key>` | `reqmo` | `reqmo` (most requests first), `cost`, `name` |
| `--explain` | off | list every drop reason rather than the top six |
| `--format <mode>` | `text` | `text` or `json` |
| `--db <path>` | opencode's store | where the history lives (`OPENCODE_DB`) |
| `--mpc <bin>` | `mpc` | catalogue source (`MPC_BIN`) |
| `--cmduse <bin>` | `cmduse` | account line (`CMDUSE_BIN`) |
| `--no-account` | off | skip the `cmduse` account line |
| `--no-color` | off | plain output (also honours `NO_COLOR`) |

### A model nobody sells

```sh
reqshape --in 0.15 --out 0.6 --cache-read 0.003 --budget 60 --five-hour 12 --weekly 30
```

`--budget` is the monthly allowance; `--five-hour` and `--weekly` are the plan's
caps, and without them those two columns show `—` rather than inventing a window.
Omit `--cache-read` and the context is billed at the input rate, flagged `*`.

## Where the numbers come from

- **Your traffic** — opencode's own store, read-only (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`).
  v2's `session_message` is read when present, the pre-v2 `message` table otherwise,
  and session metadata is joined across `session` and `session_v2`.
- **Model rates, allowances and window caps** — `mpc --json`. The 5-hour and weekly
  caps are read back from mpc's own figures, so the provider's window rule is not
  restated here where it could drift.
- **The account line** — `cmduse -1 --json`, purely as context for how much of
  your usage this profile covers. If it cannot answer, the line is simply absent.

### Per side, and back into `mpc`

`--format json` carries `sides.oc` and `sides.cc`: the same measured profile
split by whose traffic it is (requests to `opencode*` vs `command-code*`),
with each side's own request count. `mpc --shape measured` reads exactly that
payload and prices each plan on its side's shape, so its estimated `req/mo` is
"how many of *my* requests fit" instead of a fixed 800-in / 50K-cache /
200-out assumption.

Runs take about 20 seconds: both `mpc` and `cmduse` go to the network.
